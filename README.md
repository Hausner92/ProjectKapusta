# Project Kapu$ta :money_with_wings:

_Kapu$ta is the name of the project at the end of the QA engineer course at GoIT Poland, which was performed individually by each student, and its completion was a requirement for successfully finishing the course. The objective of the project was to test a web application that tracks our monthly earnings and expenses. We had to viewÂ a technical specification for the website and its graphic design in Figma. I focused mainly on functional tests and the compliance of the site with the graphic design. I also included my comments to the technical specification that would require clarification._
